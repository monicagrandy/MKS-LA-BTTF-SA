// Fix the following code to correctly print out:
// "The meaning of life: 42"
//
// Identify with a code comment if you used explicit or implicit coercion.

var a = "11", b = "31";

console.log( "The meaning of life: " + (a + b) );



// Now, write a snippet of code that demonstrates at least 3
// explicit coercions and 3 implicit coercions.
